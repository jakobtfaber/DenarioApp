**Title:** Exploiting Wavelet Scattering Networks on 21cm Intensity Maps for Efficient Inference of Early Dark Energy

**Idea:** We propose to use Wavelet Scattering Networks (WSN) to extract robust, low-dimensional features from simulated 21cm intensity maps under different EDE scenarios. These features will then be used as input to a machine learning model (e.g., Gaussian Process Regression) to efficiently infer EDE parameters. WSNs are known for their robustness to noise and ability to capture non-Gaussian information, making them ideal for dealing with foreground contamination and complex 21cm signals. We will train and validate the WSN and machine learning model on a large suite of simulations, incorporating realistic foreground models and instrumental effects. This approach will significantly reduce the computational cost compared to traditional Bayesian methods, allowing for rapid exploration of the EDE parameter space and robust constraints even with complex foregrounds and instrumental uncertainties.
